# Homework #10

This was the eighth and final coding assignment for Spring 2020's CS1570 course taught by professor Clayton Price. The problem is centered around the character Groundskeeper Willy from The Simpsons. We were limited to using only what we had been taught up to this point in the course to complete the assignment.

This assignment was made in part with a classmate, Jared Gardner, and as such equal rights to this code belong to him.
